                <h2>The Master</h2>
                <p>Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. (January 17, 1942 â€“ June 3, 2016), known professionally as Muhammad Ali,
                    was an American professional boxer, activist, and philanthropist. He is widely regarded as one of
                    the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century.</p>
                <p>Ali was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, and began boxing at the age of 12. He quickly rose
                    through the amateur ranks and won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer
                    Olympics in Rome. He turned professional later that year and soon became known for his unorthodox
                    style, quick wit, and outspoken personality.</p>
                <p>Over the course of his career, Ali became a three-time heavyweight champion and won a total of 56
                    fights, 37 of them by knockout. He was known for his legendary bouts with other great boxers of his
                    time, including Joe Frazier, George Foreman, and Sonny Liston. </p>
                <p>Outside the ring, Ali was known for his political activism and his outspoken views on civil rights
                    and social justice. He famously refused to be drafted into the Vietnam War, citing his religious
                    beliefs and opposition to the war. He was stripped of his boxing titles and banned from the sport
                    for several years, but eventually regained his titles and continued to fight until his retirement in
                    1981.</p>
                <p>Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984, and his health declined in the following decades.
                    He died on June 3, 2016, at the age of 74.</p>

                <p class="quotes">"I hated every minute of training, but I said, 'Don't quit. Suffer now and
                    live the rest of your life as a champion."</p>
